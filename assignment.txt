1. Become familiar with existing tools for running motion analysis. Focus on solutions that use cameras.
2. Summarize available tools of computer vision for human movement analysis. Mainly get familiar with skeleton detection algorithms.
3. Draft a solution using two cameras that will record human movement. One camera should record the person from the front and the other from the side.
4. Implement the drafted plan with software, that will merge data from both cameras and save body position for individual time stamps.
5. Test the solution on your own videos. Discuss possible use cases for this system.
