    "Torso Lean": """Slight forward lean while running lowers the stress on your knees. Too upright posture or leaning back might cause \"runner's knee\" syndrome, or in other words, pain in front of your knee and around your kneecap. In contrast, running bent too forwards moves the stress onto your hips and ankles. Ideal trunk lean should be around 7°, but 2°-10° is acceptable.""",
